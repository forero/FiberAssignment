The fiber allocation algorithm takes information from three different
sources: Galaxy DB, Tile DB, Fiber DB.

The following items might be needed from Galaxy DB.

1. Unique Galaxy ID (integer).
2. RA (float).
3. Dec (float).
4. Nominal type (3 character string). Must be one of the following
three: LRG, ELG, QSO.
5. Photometric Information (array of floats).
6. Number of times that this galaxy can be covered by a tile (integer).
7. n_targeted. (integer) Number of times that this galaxy has been targeted by a fiber (integer).
8. Fiber ID (array of floats). Array of size n_targeted indicating which
fiber targeted the galaxy.
9. Tile ID (array of floats). Array of size n_targeted indicating in
which tile was targeted the galaxy.

The following items might be needed from Tile DB.

1. Unique Tile ID.
2. RA (float) tile's central fiber.
3. Dec (float) tile's central fiber.

The following items might be needed from Fiber DB.

1. Unique fiber ID (integer).
2. RA (float) Nominal RA if the center of the fiber distribution is
located over the equator.
3. Dec (float) Nominal Dec if the center of the fiber distribution is
located over the equator.
3. Fiber size (float).
4. Patrol radius (float).

The following items might be the output after one fiber allocation pass.

1. n_match (integer). Number of galaxies that were targeted after one pass.
2. FiberID_match (array of floats). Array of FiberIDs of size n_match
listing the fibers targeting a galaxy.
3. GalaxyID_match (array of floats). Array of GalaxyIDs of size
n_match listing the galaxies targeted by a fiber.
