The fiber allocation algorithm takes information from three different
sources (Data Bases): Galaxy DB, Field DB, Fiber DB.

The following items might be needed from Galaxy DB.

1. Unique Galaxy ID (integer).
2. RA (float).
3. Dec (float).
4. Nominal type (string). Must be one of the following
three: LRG, ELG, QSO.
5. Photometric Information (array of floats). Depends on the broadband magnitudes available for this object.
6. Number of fields that include this galaxy (integer).
7. n_targeted. (integer) Number of times that this galaxy has been targeted by a fiber including all the different fields(integer).
8. Fiber ID (array of ints). Array of size n_targeted indicating which
fiber has targeted the galaxy.
9. Field ID (array of floats). Array of size n_targeted indicating in
which field was targeted the galaxy.

The following items might be needed from Field DB.

1. Unique Field ID.
2. RA (float) fields's RA measured on the central fiber.
3. Dec (float) fields's Dec measured on the central fiber.

The following items might be needed from Fiber DB.

1. Unique Fiber ID (integer).
1. n_fiber (integer) total number of available fibers.
2. RA (array of float) Nominal RA values if the center of the fiber distribution is
located over the equator.
3. Dec (array of float) Nominal Dec values if the center of the fiber distribution is
located over the equator.
3. Fiber size (float).
4. Patrol radius (float).

The following items might be the output after one fiber allocation pass.

1. n_match (integer). Number of galaxies that were targeted after one pass.
2. FiberID_match (array of floats). Array of Fiber IDs of size n_match
listing the fibers targeting a galaxy.
3. GalaxyID_match (array of floats). Array of Galaxy IDs of size
n_match listing the galaxies targeted by a fiber.
